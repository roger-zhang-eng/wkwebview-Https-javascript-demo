# wkwebview-test
update kinderas's blog to swift 2.0

#Hi
This is a demo of wkwebview in iOS(from 8.0). I read Kinderas's blog, and tried what he says. But it won't work in Swift 2.0.
So I update the source code. If you want to check the original blog, please go to:

Big THANKS To Kinder√•s!!

#How to use
#Step1
Setup [Web sever](https://getgrav.org/blog/mac-os-x-apache-setup-ssl) and set index.html/main.js (in wkdemo) in website root directory

#Step2
Run iOS project to check UI and log print.
Note:
'webview func of didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge' is only to add the unverified SSL certificates in webview.
